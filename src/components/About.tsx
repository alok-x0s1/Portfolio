			<p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
				I&apos;m Alok Yadav, and my goal is to create exceptional,
				innovative web experiences that not only perform seamlessly but
				also leave a lasting impact. My journey as a developer has been
				a rewarding self-taught adventure driven by a deep-seated
				passion for technology.
			</p>

			<p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
				What distinguishes me is my dedication to ongoing learning.
				Whether it&apos;s through exploring online tutorials, consulting
				with mentors, or staying updated with the latest technologies,
				I&apos;m constantly seeking to expand my knowledge.
			</p>

			<p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
				But life isn&apos;t just about tech! When I&apos;m not coding,
				you might find me relaxing with a good book, writing blog posts,
				or diving into exciting video games. I also enjoy playing the
				guitar, finding joy and relaxation in music.
